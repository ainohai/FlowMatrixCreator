# FlowMatrixCreator

I have been toying with creating generative art and I have a need for toolset for using some general generative art concepts. 
So, this is a WIP project and a starting point for that. There is still long way to go to get to the goal. This is also a starter for a bigger personal art project "Madonna of Machines". 

## Current features
- Sets random "magnets" on the canvas.
- Creates a grid based on the strength and placement of magnets.
- Creates agents which move on the grid. Their velocity is based on the grid created with magnets
- User can set configs by modifying config-file.
